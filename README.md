  Appsilon FrontEnd assignment - Kuzmych Valentyna
</h1>

I decided to crate Test project using Gatsby framework

Also I use Bootstrap and FontAwesome font there.

There is no 100% fit with Mockup icons, I just used the most similar to speed up development.
In real projects, for sure, icons should be 100% like in design :) Usually I created font from vector icons.

As there were mo design for mobile I've realized responsive by the simplest way.

thank you for the chance to play with Getsby :) It is cool stuff
